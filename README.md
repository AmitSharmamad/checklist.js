# checklist.js

Following the below best practices of Security for a Node.js Application
in the format

# - [ ] concept (recommended node.js library)

- [ ] Infra

  - [ ] Enable http(s)
  - [ ] nginx
    - [ ] Rate Limiting (cloud based / in-house)
    - [ ] Load Balancing
  - [ ] Run Node.js applications in non-root user mode

- [ ] Application

  - [ ] Authentication ( username/password or jwt validation )
  - [ ] Authorization ( permissions )
  - [ ] Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (cors)
  - [ ] Cross-Site Scripting (xss)
  - [ ] input header validation ( helmet )
  - [ ] input body validation ( class-validator and class-transformer )
  - [ ] jwt invalidation ( cache and invalidate to stop attacks against compromised jwts )
  - [ ] handle basic status codes ( 4xx and 5xx )

- [ ] Database
  - [ ] Encrypting passwords (bcrypt)

# Gemini Advanced Suggestions (to be refined)

- [ ] Infrastructure Security

  - [ ] Secure Network Configuration:
    - [ ] Firewall implementation and configuration
    - [ ] Intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS)
    - [ ] Network segmentation and isolation
    - [ ] Secure protocols (e.g., HTTPS, SSH)
    - [ ] Regular vulnerability scanning and patching
  - [ ] Secure Server Hardening:
    - [ ] Disable unnecessary services and ports
    - [ ] Strong password policies and access controls
    - [ ] Regular security updates and patches
    - [ ] Secure configuration of web servers, application servers, and databases
  - [ ] Secure Cloud Infrastructure:
    - [ ] Secure cloud configuration (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP)
    - [ ] Identity and access management (IAM)
    - [ ] Data encryption at rest and in transit
    - [ ] Monitoring and logging of cloud activities

- [ ] Application Security

  - [ ] Secure Coding Practices:
    - [ ] Input validation and sanitization
    - [ ] Output encoding
    - [ ] Authentication and authorization
    - [ ] Session management
    - [ ] Error handling and logging
    - [ ] Secure use of cryptography
  - [ ] Security Testing:
    - [ ] Static application security testing (SAST)
    - [ ] Dynamic application security testing (DAST)
    - [ ] Penetration testing
    - [ ] Vulnerability scanning
  - [ ] Web Application Firewall (WAF):
    - [ ] Implementation and configuration of a WAF
    - [ ] Regular rule updates and tuning

- [ ] Database Security

  - [ ] Secure Database Configuration:
    - [ ] Strong passwords and access controls
    - [ ] Least privilege principle
    - [ ] Encryption of sensitive data
    - [ ] Regular backups and disaster recovery plans
  - [ ] Database Activity Monitoring (DAM):
    - [ ] Implementation and configuration of DAM
    - [ ] Monitoring for suspicious activities and anomalies
  - [ ] Data Masking and Anonymization:
    - [ ] Implementation of data masking and anonymization for sensitive data
    - [ ] Compliance with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR)

- [ ] Additional Considerations:

  - [ ] Regular Security Assessments: Conduct regular security assessments and audits to identify and address vulnerabilities.
  - [ ] Security Awareness Training: Provide security awareness training to employees and developers.
  - [ ] Incident Response Plan: Develop and test an incident response plan to handle security incidents effectively.
  - [ ] Compliance: Ensure compliance with relevant security standards and regulations (e.g., PCI DSS, HIPAA).
